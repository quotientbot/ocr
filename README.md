# OCR-API
The microservice that powers [Quotient's](https://github.com/quotientbot/Quotient-Bot/) image text extraction & image duplicacy detection needs.

## What it does?
If put simply, In response to an HTTP request containing an array of Image URLs, the API performs the following:
* Make those images sharper, remove colors, etc., and then extract whatever text they contain.
* Generate a [Perceptual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing) & [Difference hash](https://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html) for the images.

> In response to a valid HTTP Post request, a similar response to the following example is expected.
